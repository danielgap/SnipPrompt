# Administrator's Guide - SnippetBox2

## Introduction

Congratulations! If you are reading this, you have been designated as an **Administrator** for SnippetBox2. This role grants you special capabilities to manage the platform and its users.

This guide will explain how to access and use your privileges.

---

## 1. The First Administrator

The system is designed so that **the first user who registers automatically becomes an administrator**. This ensures that the platform always has at least one person with the necessary permissions to start managing it.

## 2. Accessing the Admin Panel

Once you log in with your administrator account, you will notice a new link in the main navigation bar called **"Admin"**.

Click this link to access the **User Management Panel**.

## 3. User Management

The admin panel presents you with a table of all registered users in the system. For each user, you can see their ID, username, email, current role, and whether their account is active.

From this panel, you can perform the following actions:

### Promote to Administrator
- **Button:** `Promote` (green)
- **Action:** Assigns the `admin` role to a regular user. This will give them access to this same panel and all administrative capabilities.
- **When to use it?:** When you need to delegate administrative responsibilities to another trusted team member.

### Demote to User
- **Button:** `Demote` (yellow)
- **Action:** Revokes `admin` privileges from an account, returning it to the normal `user` role.
- **Restriction:** You cannot demote yourself. This action must be performed by another administrator.

### Delete User
- **Button:** `Delete` (red)
- **Action:** **Permanently deletes** a user's account, along with all their associated data. This action is **irreversible**. You will be asked for confirmation before proceeding.
- **Restriction:** You cannot delete your own administrator account.

## 4. Security Considerations

- **Be careful:** The actions of promoting and deleting have a major impact on the platform's security and data.
- **Principle of least privilege:** Grant administrator permissions only to those who truly need them.
- **Don't self-destruct:** The system prevents you from deleting or demoting yourself to avoid leaving the platform without administrators.
